- https://github.com/kosso/titanium-postmessage-webview/tree/master/tiwebview2_android

```
// uses for testing
		url: "iframetest/remote_test.html"

```
- upgraded crosswalk still crashes when trying to use ti.app.addeventlistener

# 20171016
- uploading setData with blob and baseURL option
- showing that Ti.App.addEventListener works even with an iframe if the listeners are added onto the child "blank_withscript.html".
- note that the parent inline jscript is able to count the correct number of frames.
- but the child can't access the parent through window.top,
- need another way to communicate with the parent.
- e.g. maybe via postMessage,
- work in progress,
