# Todo
- try to communicate from child to parent via postMessage 


# 20171016
- uploading setData with blob and baseURL option
- showing that Ti.App.addEventListener works even with an iframe if the listeners are added onto the child.
- note that the parent is able to count the correct number of frames.
- but the child can't access the parent through window.top,
- need another way to communicate with the parent.
- e.g. maybe via postMessage
